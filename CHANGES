2.1.3

- Minor GUI fixes.

- Subtle bug fix by Bryan Huh which _may_ help resolve the bug that
  affects saving when page ranges are in effect.

2.1.2

- Minor GUI bug fixes.

- Minor translation fixes.

- Updated copyright year.

2.1.1

- Tiny bug fix to make sure that the help file is in the right language.

2.1.0

- Dragging and and dropping files from Windows Explorer, Thunar, etc.,
  now works (at least for me, on Windows 7 and Xubuntu).

- Updated Czech translation from Pavel Fric.

- French translation from Pierre-Alain Bandinelli.

- German translation (and many suggestions) from Rainer Krachten.

- Translations should "just work"; i.e., if you use a French locale then
  the user interface and help text should appear in French. However, you
  can force DiffPDF to use any language it supports by using the
  --language command line option (e.g., --language=fr). If an
  unsupported locale or --language option is used, DiffPDF will fall
  back to English.

- Now support -h as a synonym for --help.

- Initial path defaults to home directory instead of DiffPDF's
  installation directory.

- Improved the Options dialog's layout.

- A subtle bugfix to the --words command line option.

- Fixed a crash: clicking to set a margin when there're no PDFs loaded
  now safely does nothing.


2.0.0

- Can now have comparisons exclude text that's outside user-specified
  margins. This feature was sponsored by a company that prefers to
  remain anonymous.

- Save As can now save images as well as PDFs.

- Minor bug fixes and improvements.

- Command line help (--help) will no longer work on Windows. This is to
  avoid a spurious console window appearing. I've put the output in the
  online help though.

- Improved dock window handling so that docks can now be stacked on top
  of each other (useful for small screens).

1.9.2

- Added missing step to the README.

1.9.1

- Save As now preserves the aspect ratio. Bug reported by Rainer
  Krachten.

1.9.0

- Added Czech translation provided by Pavel Fric.

- Will now use the default locale's language for standard dialogs (e.g.,
  for the file dialog).

- Dragging & dropping one or two files onto the filename line edits or
  onto the file viewer panels is now supported. Independently suggested
  by Liviu Andronic and Rory Gordon. (This does not seem to work on
  Windows.)

- Show Zones checkbox is always visible (it was only visible with
  --debug in earlier versions).

- DiffPDF now starts up with its initial comparison mode being whatever
  comparison mode was in force when it was shut down (or Words mode the
  first time it is run).

- Improved About box with more version info + contributors.

- Added --help command line option. (For Windows this only works if
  diffpdf is compiled with access to the console.)

1.8.0

- Introduced zoning: this can be slow in Characters mode but can provide
  better accuracy in text modes.

1.7.1

- Improved Character mode to be as liberal about hyphens as Words mode.
- Minor doc changes that I forgot for 1.7.0.
- Minor GUI bug fixes and changes.
- Minor under the hood efficiency improvements.

1.7.0

- Renamed Text mode to Words mode. This mode is best for alphabetic text
  (e.g., English).
- Added Characters mode. This mode is best for logographic text (e.g.,
  Chinese and Japanese). This was suggested by Paul Howarth.

1.6.3

- Very minor cosmetic changes.

1.6.2

- Save button is now only enabled if there are changes.
- An improved help window with slightly more information.

1.6.1

- In rare cases the highlighting on the right hand page could be in the
  wrong (horizontal) position; this has now been fixed.

1.6.0

- In addition to Appearance comparisons using highlighting, some
  composition modes can now be used to help make subtle differences more
  visible. (This was inspired by feedback by Florian Heiderich.)
- Can now control the square size for appearance comparisons. Using very
  small squares can help reveal tiny Appearance differences.
- Can now control the fill opacity for highlighting.
- Extended zoom range from 20% to 800% (was 25% to 400%).

1.5.1

Quite a few false-positives have now been eliminated:
- All hyphens are treated the same now.
- Some weirdly-encoded open/close double-quotes are treated as normal
  Unicode open/close double-quotes.
- Improved whitespace ignoring.

1.5.0

Added Save As action and dialog for saving the differences to a PDF file.

1.3.0

Added support for -a, --appearance, -t, --text command line options to
set the initial comparison mode.

1.2.3

Added a mention of comparepdf in the About box.

1.2.2

Tiny change in how command line arguments are handled. This should make
things work with both English and non-English locales on Windows.

1.2.1

Minor improvement with focus control for Previous and Next buttons.

Acknowledged Steven Lee for building Windows binaries and Dirk Loss for
building Mac OS X binaries in the About box.

1.2.0

Got rid of old text comparison mode.

Various small user interface improvements.

Fixed a subtle bug that meant the combine text highlighting setting
wasn't saved and restored correctly.

1.1.5

Slightly changed the .pro file to make it a tiny bit more helpful.
Added a Help button and separated Help and About information.
Updated the README for Mac users (thanks to Dirk Loss for the info).

1.1.4

Improved the reporting of files that are the same.

1.1.3

Tiny bugfix for Debian.

1.1.2

It is now possible for the user to control whether highlighting is
combined in text mode.

Added a cache for page images. This makes it much quicker to flick back
and forth between pages. The cache size can be set by the user: the
bigger the cache the more pages that can be flicked through without
recalculating.

1.1.1

Replaced QVariant::toReal() with QVariant::toDouble() to avoid breaking
compatibility with Qt 4.4.

1.1.0

Added margin rules to indicate where changes are. (These can be turned
off by setting a rule width of 0.0.)

1.0.0

Implemented the sequence matcher algorithm for text mode matching.

0.6.0

Redid the user interface to use dock widgets.

0.5.0

First release.
